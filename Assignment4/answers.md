# 1. Why the movie ID should come from the URL instead of the request body
# =========================================================================
The URL identifies *which* record to act on (e.g. `PUT /movies/5`), so the ID belongs there. 
Taking it from the URL avoids ambiguity and ID tampering, 
since the body should carry only the data to update, not the record's identity.

# ======================================================================
## 2. Why PUT should not increase the number of records
# ======================================================================

PUT updates an existing record, it does not create new ones — that is POST's job.
PUT is idempotent, so calling it repeatedly must leave the record count unchanged.
